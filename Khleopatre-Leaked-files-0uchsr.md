In 2018, she was invited to participate in the Venice Biennale, one of the most prestigious art events in the world. Khleopatre has also received several awards for her work, including the Young Artist of the Year Award from the British Art Awards in 2016. Born in 1995, Khleopatre grew up in a musical family and began singing at a young age.
